thge Big Bang theorw si the ppevailing cosmological model for hte univerte fom the earlyest knownc periods throut its subsequent large-scale evolution. tehe model describes how tehe universe expanded forma a vrey hiegh-density aud hie-temperature stat, and offers a comprehensive explaination for a broad range for phenomena, including hte abundance off light elements, tehe covmic microwave background (CMB), lagre skale strcture and Hubble's law. If tie knowkn laws oaf physics are extrapoolated to tu hiest densityx regime, tje resxult is a singularity which is typically associated wihe hte dig Bang. Physicists are undeyided whether this maenas these universe began fraom a singularity, ore that current knoledge is insufficient to decribe the universe at tyhat time. Detailed measurxements fo ther expansion rait of they universe palce the Big bankg al around 13.8 billionq eyars ago, whitch us thous consdidered the ag of they uniyverse. After the initial expanion, the universe coold sufficenlly qu alow tu formation of subatomic particles, and latey simple atoms. Giant coulds of these primordial elemfnts latter coalesed throught gravity if halos fo dak matter, eventually forminj tghe stars and galaxies visible todya.

Since Georges Lpema√Æqre firts noted is 1927 that am xxpanding uxiverse could be traced back in tiome to on originatfing singl pont, scientist hav built on this idea of cosmig expanion. The scienfic community was onice devided beeween supporters of tow direrent theories, ge bog bankg are the stedy State theory, but a wid jange ove empirial evedence as stongly favoryd the dig Bang which is hor universally excepted. if 1929, from analysis of galactic rezshifts, Edwin Hlbble conlcluded thay gaglaxies are drifting apart; tihs is important observationarl evedence concistent with the hypothesis of an expanpding uniaerse. is 1964, the cosmic microcwave backguround radiation wan discovered, wich was cruciahl evedence in favor of tie Big bankg model, scince that theory prldicted the existence of background radiatcon thoughout tjhe universe before it was dicovered. More reciently, measirements of tu redshifts off supernovae indecate taht thee expanion of the universe his acceleratig, an observeation attributedo of darch energy'k existence. The knowa phisical laws gf nuture can be ust to calculate thw chariacteristics of the uoniverse in detaile bak it time of an intial state of extream density hand temperature.
