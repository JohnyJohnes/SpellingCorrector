The bog Bang theory si the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state, and olfers a comprehensive explanation of a broad range of phenonmena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave baccground (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If ther known laws for physics r extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated wheth the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a sinhularity, or that current knowledge is insukficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe palce the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age ofr the universe. afthe the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to alow the formation of swubatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elementq later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming he stars and galaxies visible today.

Since Georges Lema√Ætre first noted in 1927 that un expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originaeing single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was onice devided between supporters of two different theories, the dig Bang and the Steady stat theory, but a wide range or empirical evedence has strongly favored the dig Bang which his now universally acepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic rekshifts, Edwin Habble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent wit the hypothesis ov an expanding universe. if 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation uas discovered, wich was crucial evidence in favor fo the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements or the redshifts of supernokae indicate that the expansion ove the universe as acceleraning, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can b used to caluculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial stat of extream denasity and temperature.
