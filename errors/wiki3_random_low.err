The Big Bang theory is thv prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes howkp the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state, and owffers a comprehensive explanation for a byroad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwavel background (CMB), large scalep structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws oy physics are exarapfolated to the highest density regime, the resulti is a singularity which is typically associated with the Biyg Bang. Physicists are undeckided whether tois means the universe began cfrom a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed mxeasurements of tbhe expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at xrould 13.8 billion years mago, which is thus cosnsicered the xgd of thve universe. Abter the initial expansion, the univeurse cooled sufficiently to allow tshe formation of subatomic particles, aqwnd later sigmple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity iln halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and aalajxies visible today.

Since Georges Lema√Ætre firaq noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could bfe tqraced back in time to an originating single pjoinj, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once bxvided between subporyers of two different theories, the Big Bang mand the Steady Sthate theory, bug a wide rangye of empiricaul evidence has strongly favored the Big zanrg which is now universally accepted. Ino 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Epwin Hujmble concfludnd that galaxies are drifting apart; this is importanft observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding ugiverse. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovseres, which was crucial evidence bin fatvor cm the Big Bang model, since that theory predictedv thw existence of background radiation thxroughout the universe before rt was discovered. More recentjy, measurements of the redshifts of suprprnovae indmicatze that the expansion ofkc the unimerse is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be usedn tco calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial state of extreme density and temperature.
