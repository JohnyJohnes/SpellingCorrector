the Big bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes of toe universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperatures state, tend offer a comprehensive explanation form a broad range cbs phenomena, including sher abundance udf light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. if the known laws of physics as extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result fm a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means theo universe began fsm a singularity, tory thaw current knowledge is insufficient mo describe the universe at that quite. Detailed measurements of one epxatnsion rate of ten universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years aden, which is thus considered the uv of theft universe. after the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of she primordial elements later coalesced through gravity ind urals of day matter, eventually forming ute states and galaxies visible today.

Since Georges lemma√Ætre first noted in 1927 then ai expanding universe could be traced lack in time to and originating single point, scientists wave built no his idea of cosmic expansion. Thy scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the big bang and the Steady state theory, but a wide manage of empirical evidence his strongly afford the Big bang munich job new universally accepted. In 1929, film analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are driving apart; this is important observational evidenced consistent with the hypothesis own axon expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which who crucial evidence ins favor of the jig Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence bok background radiation throughout the universe before im was discovered. more recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universal ecs accelerating, an obseorvaiton attributed to dprk energy's existence. the known physical large of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to bc initial state of extreme density and temperature.
